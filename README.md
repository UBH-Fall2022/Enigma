# UB Hacking Fall 2022 Rules 
- Teams can consist of between 1 and 4 people.
- To have your submission be considered for judging, you must submit a 2-5 minute video along with your project. Try to keep it as concise as possible!
- The projects submitted for judging cannot have been started prior to the start of the hackathon. In other words, teams can plan their projects in great detail, but they cannot begin writing code until they arrive at the hackathon.
- Additionally, we are partnering with MLH this year, which means that our hackers must follow their code of conduct which can be found here.
- Any and all resources used must be open source and specified in either the project, or the project description.
- Your project must be publically available and under source control (organizers need to be able to view your code repository) -  you can use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any other code hosting service
- Projects can not have been submitted to another event, including other hackathons this weekend.

## Our Inspiration
Data privacy is a huge concern with likes of data collection from many companies for persona based advertisement, dataset for training machine learning models, Artificial Intelligence etc. This problem is deeply rooted in the way we create digital identity. Our identity works on single point of authentication using federated identity services which is very flawed mechanishm of identifcation. Because, this identity provider serves as single point for accessing multiple services and is prone to data breach. So blockchain based Self-Sovereign Identity helps us tackle this issue.


## What it does
Using Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) from Sovrin Foundation, we can tackle to probelm from single identity provider. What its does is, we are not relying on single identity provider instead, players in SSI identity network will communicate in peer-to-peer fashion. Using Self-Sovereign Identity, Enigma creates digital identity for users, and users can use this for identification accross muitple platforms. We are providing this solution for a one specific use-case of dataset collection and rewarding. Using this users can safegaurd their privacy using DIDs and decide what data to be shared with dataset collectors
